This plugin allows updating the Shipping address order to the information that is registered in the Store.

== Description ==

With this plugin, you will be able to force the Shipping details to be updated to the Store shipping address, since that is a Local Pickup Store, and the shipping is supposed to be the Store.

== Installation ==

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you donâ€™t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of this plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New and search for Update Shipping Order Address - WC Pickup Store.
